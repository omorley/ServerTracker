I would like to build a program to track servers in the data centre and their projected power utilization.

Classes:
	Cabinet
		name
		servers
		facility
		powerCircuits
	Server
		name
		ip
		purpose
		owner
		projectedPower
		processors
		cores
		memory
		serviceTag
		warrantyExpiration
		externalStorage
	ExternalStorage
		name
		projectedPower
	PowerCCT
		name
		ups
		amperage

Use case 1:
	Print a report of all cabinets and their power usage

Use case 2:
	Identify circuits that are projected to be overloaded

Use case 3:
	List out servers that are using the most power in a specific cabinet
	

# This is a test.
